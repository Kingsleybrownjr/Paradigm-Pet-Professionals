					<h1>Welcome Dog Lovers!</h1>
					<p>
						The domestic dog is an extremely social animal and offers a diverse
						variety of choices as there are well over 300 breeds recognized by
						the World Canine Organization. Adopting a dog offers mutual benefits
						between dog and owner. Many studies cite the social benefits of
						having a companion as well as the reduced feelings of loneliness
						from adopting a dog. Studies even show medical indicators such as
						<a
							href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554"
							>reduced blood pressure and improved lipid profiles</a
						>. If you have a dog, it is important to make sure that you care for
						your dog; be mindful of what you feed your dog and provide enough
						opportunities for exercise. In this page, you will find more
						information about how to care for your pets throughout the various
						stages of their lives.

					<h4>Diet & Exercise</h4>
					<p>
						Throughout dogs’ lifespans, they should generally be fed fewer meals
						as they mature. Puppies should be nursed the first two months, then
						introduced to three meals per day when they are about three to six
						months years old. Their food intake should be reduced to two meals
						per day when they are six months to one year old and finally reduced
						to one meal after they reach one year old. And a dog’s typical body
						mass is composed of somewhere between 60 and 70 percent water. The
						<a class="bold-links" href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> says
						just a 10 percent decrease in body water can cause illness, and a 15
						percent loss can cause death, so make sure you keep your pooch
						hydrated! Much like humans, dogs need to have a healthy level of
						activity to keep their organs healthy, as well as sun and fresh air.
						The minimum recommended time for exercise varies greatly with breed
						and size differences, but generally a range of 30–120 minutes of
						exercise is recommended per day! Can you imagine exercising two
						hours per day? OK, I know that wouldn't bother some of you reading
						this. But the thought of it to me makes me cringe! And by the way,
						exercising your dog does not mean you are being challenged to a
						push-up contest. Brisk walks are OK too! You can also choose from a
						variety of toys to encourage physical activity; just be sure they
						are age appropriate and do not pose a choking hazard. Pay careful
						attention to toys that require supervision.
					</p>

					<h4>Grooming & Handling</h4>
					<p>
						Keeping your furry family member clean is important to its health.
						So be sure to brush frequently to reduce the amount of shedding and
						prevent matted and tangled fur that can prove to be extremely
						difficult to remove. Check for insects such as ticks and fleas,
						especially after visiting heavily wooded areas. Bathing is not only
						important to your dog’s health but can be an exercise depending on
						how strong willed the dog is. <span class="bold">Rinse</span> all of
						the soap out, as any residual soap can result in a rash. Be sure the
						soap is formulated for your puppy or dog, since harsh soaps can
						cause allergic reactions. And as always, be careful how you handle
						your loved one. No matter the size of your dog, you need to be
						cautious as you carry your canine. If you have a small dog, then
						cradle the pup with one hand under the chest and the forearm
						supporting the back half. If it is a large dog, reach under the
						belly with both your arms perpendicular to the dog, and use each arm
						to support the chest and rear as you lift.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Vaccinations & Medications</h4>
					<p>
						You should <span class="bold">always</span> consult with your
						veterinarian, but there is a core set of vaccines that are typically
						recommended. Vaccines that reduce the exposure risk to things such
						as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Others may be determined by
						your vet depending on the environment in which the dog resides. Some
						of these include
						<a
							href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet"
							>Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira
							bacteria</a
						>.
