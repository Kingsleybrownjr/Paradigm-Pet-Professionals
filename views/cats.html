					<h1>Welcome Cat Lovers!</h1>
					<p>
						Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia
						region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the
						United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds,
						care and diet can differ between breeds. However, some diets and
						practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your
						fluffy family member regardless of breed.

					<h4>Zero to Four Weeks</h4>
					<p>
						It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat
						that is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if
						possible. Monitor your kitten’s growth closely to make sure its
						growth rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at
						a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten
						directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube. Some reasons why
						kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following:

						<ul class="animal-feeding_info__list">
							<li>Too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
							<li>Gastrointestinal disease</li>
							<li>Environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Four Weeks to One Year</h4>
					<p>
						Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically
						around three to four weeks after birth. According to the
						<a class="bold-links" href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age
						should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces
						of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties eating
						hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food.
						Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional
						nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness.
						Depending on the breed, your cat may have different dietary
						requirements. You should always consult with your veterinarian for
						recommendations.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>One Year to Seven Years</h4>
					<p>
						This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many
						nutrients. At this age, their level of activity decreases, and so
						does their metabolism. It is
						<span class="bold">not</span> recommended to leave food out for the
						cats all day. Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat
						meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces
						the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h4>Seven Years and More</h4>
					<p>
						Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and
						experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should eat less fats
						and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are
						purchasing packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a
						particular protein (such as "salmon") and <span class="bold">not</span> just a category (such
						as fish). This usually means they are byproducts, or combinations,
						of lesser quality proteins.
